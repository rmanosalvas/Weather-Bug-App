AS A traveler
I WANT to see the weather outlook for multiple cities
SO THAT I can plan a trip accordingly
```

## How it works

When the user types in a city in the input and clicks the search button they will be given weather information for that city. 
The information will include the city name, weather conditions, temperature, humidity, wind speed, and UV Index.
Along with this information the user will also be given a 5 day forecast that includes weather conditions, temperature, and humidity.
The city's that are searched will then also be saved for future use!
